# 🛡️ RBAC User Management System

A robust user management system implemented in **TypeScript**, focusing on **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** and audit logging.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project simulates a backend service for managing user identities and permissions. It enforces strict typing for user roles (Admin, Manager, User) and permissions (Read, Write, Delete), ensuring secure operation execution.

### ✨ Key Features

- **User CRUD:** Creation of users with auto-generated secure passwords.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Verification of permissions based on assigned roles (`Enum`).
- **Audit Logging:** A centralized log system that records every action performed within the system for security auditing.
- **Strong Typing:** Extensive use of TypeScript `Interfaces` and `Enums` to prevent runtime errors.
